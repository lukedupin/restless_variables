RestlessVariables
=================

Restless_Variables are a different mind set.  Instead of the division of
instance variables and user posted variables feeling clunky, they now feel 
equal.  This is done by a special naming scheme that changes the rules about
how web programing is done.


Example
=======

Inside application.rb

require 'restless_variables'

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    #Called by the user to to convert thier variables
  around_filter :restless_variable_filter
  include RestlessVariables
end

Now if a form posts the variable "username" under the login form.
@_login.username can be used instead of params[:login][:username]

Storing sesison variables is a snap!
instead of 
	session[:uid] = 8
use this
@__uid = 8
